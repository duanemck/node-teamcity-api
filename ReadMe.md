TeamCity Library for Node.js

Forked from https://github.com/peter-murray/node-teamcity-api with the ambition of completing it as time allows.

This library provides a wrapper around various TeamCity REST API calls, to provide validation and processing to ensure
a consistent interface. Something that the real REST end points for TeamCity do not do (it is a mixture of XML, JSON and
various return types that are not necessarily valid JSON).
